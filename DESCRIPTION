Description: Bayesian additive regression trees (BART) provides flexible non-parametric modeling of mixed-type predictors for continuous and binary responses. This package is built upon CRAN R package BART, version 2.7 (<https://github.com/cran/BART>). It implements the three proposed variable selection approaches in the paper: Luo, C and Daniels, M. J. (2021), "Variable Selection Using Bayesian Additive Regression Trees." arXiv:2112.13998, and other three existing BART-based variable selection approaches.
