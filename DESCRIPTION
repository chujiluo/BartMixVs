Description: Bayesian additive regression trees (BART) provides flexible nonparametric modeling of mixed-type predictors for continuous and binary responses. This package is built upon CRAN R package BART, version 2.7 (https://github.com/cran/BART). It implements three proposed variable selection approaches of the paper, Luo, C and Daniels, MJ (2022), Variable Selection Using Bayesian Additive Regreesion Trees, and other three existing BART-based variable selection approaches.
